# Project Guidelines - Online Cookbook

**Data Centric Development**

- Logic must be written in Python. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to enhance the look and feel of the cookbook.

- Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
- The website must be data-driven and can rely on structured data, unstructured data or a mix of structured and unstructured data.
- CRUD operations can be carried out using either SQL (e.g. MySQL/SQLite/Postgres) or NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB).
- Use Flask, a micro-framework, to run your application. Provide instructions on how to run your project locally in your README.
- Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers.
- Share details of how you created your database schema in your README. Consider sharing working drafts or finalised versions of your database schema in a 'Database Schema' folder in your repo. Provide a link to this folder in your README.
- We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
- The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
- Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. If some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
- Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
- Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
