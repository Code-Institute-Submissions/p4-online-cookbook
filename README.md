## 11 Testing

**Automated Tests**

I used the Test Before approach of Test-Driven Development in this project, writing a test that fails, and then writing the code to pass the test using Python's unittest class.

[Test file available here](https://github.com/sarahloh/p4-online-cookbook/blob/master/test_cookbook.py)

To run the file use the follwing terminal command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_cookbook.py
```

---

1. Sign up form:
    1. Go to the "Sign Up" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit an existing username and verify that an error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears on home page.

2. Log in form:
    1. Go to the "Log in form" in navbar or sign up page
    2. Try to submit the empty form or incorrect username and verify that an error message appears
    3. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears on home page.

3. Favourite a recipe:
    1. Try to favourite a recipe when not logged in and verify page redirects to sign up / log in page


---

I used a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) grid to structure the frontend and and the site **responsive**. Using mobile first design, I started with the mobile screen and worked up through tablet, desktop and large desktop, altering the layout accordingly.

**Mobile**

- iPhone 5 Safari
- Chrome Developer Tools

**Tablet**

- Chrome Developer Tools

**Desktop**

- Chrome
- Safari
